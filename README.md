# 🌌 EchoesOfKnowledge

> *"Every answer is an echo of something once known — retrieved, understood, and reborn through reason."*

**EchoesOfKnowledge** is a **Groq-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built to converse using **only your curated knowledge base**.  
By blending **semantic embeddings**, **intelligent chunking**, and **blazing-fast Groq inference**, it transforms scattered fragments of data into coherent, trustworthy answers.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Groq-Powered LLM** — Harness ultra-fast inference for near-instant responses.
- 📚 **Knowledge-Bound** — Speaks only from the provided chunked dataset.
- 🧩 **Intelligent Chunking** — Preserves context while splitting large documents.
- 🎯 **Semantic Retrieval** — Embedding-based vector search for precise context fetching.
- 🛡 **Hallucination Shield** — Out-of-scope queries are gracefully declined.
- 💬 **Conversational Memory** *(optional)* — Keeps track of recent dialogue for multi-turn conversations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EchoesOfKnowledge.git
cd EchoesOfKnowledge
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare Your Data

* Place your documents in the `data/` folder.
* Run the embedding script:

```bash
python backend/embed_data.py
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Backend

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

### 5️⃣ Open the Chat UI

* Navigate to `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language Models**: Groq (Mixtral / LLaMA)
* **Vector Search**: FAISS / Chroma
* **Embeddings**: `sentence-transformers` / OpenAI embeddings
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask)
* **Frontend**: HTML / CSS / JS

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Chunking** — Large documents are split into overlapping text chunks for better retrieval.
2. **Embedding** — Each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector.
3. **Storage** — Embeddings are stored in a vector database.
4. **Query** — User’s question is embedded and matched to top-k relevant chunks.
5. **Generation** — Retrieved chunks + query are sent to Groq LLM for an answer.
6. **Validation** — If relevant context is missing, it responds: *"I don't know."*

## 🛡 Out-of-Scope Handling

If a user asks something **not present** in your dataset,
`EchoesOfKnowledge` will *refuse to guess* — ensuring reliability over creativity.
